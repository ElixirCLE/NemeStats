<h3 style="text-decoration: underline">What Are Badges?</h3>
<p>
    "Badges" in NemeStats are special awards and designations that call out the state of a Player within a Gaming Group. The Badges that we currently support are:
    <table class="table table-striped" id="aboutbadges">
        <tr>
            <td class="col-md-2 badgeico">
                <i class="@NemesisBadgeViewModel.ICON_CSS_CLASS" data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="right"
                   data-content="@NemesisBadgeViewModel.POPOVER_TEXT">
                </i>
            </td>
            <td class="col-md-2"><b>Nemesis</b></td>
            <td class="col-md-8">Become someone's Nemesis by beating them at least 3 times, having a greater than 50% win ratio vs. them, and having a higher
                win percentage against them than anyone else.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="col-md-2 badgeico">
                <i class="@MinionBadgeViewModel.FONT_AWESOME_CSS_CLASS" data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="right"
                   data-content="@MinionBadgeViewModel.POPOVER_TEXT">
                </i>
            </td>
            <td class="col-md-2"><b>Minion</b></td>
            <td class="col-md-8">
                A Minion is the opposite of a Nemesis. If you are someone's mininon, then you are their Nemesis, and vice versa. Having minions
                is good; being a minion is bad.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="col-md-1 badgeico">
                <i class="@ChampionBadgeViewModel.FONT_AWESOME_CSS_CLASS" data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="right"
                   data-content="@ChampionBadgeViewModel.POPOVER_TEXT">
                </i>
            </td>
            <td class="col-md-2"><b>Champion</b></td>
            <td class="col-md-8">
                Each Game within a Gaming Group can have at most a single Champion. The Champion is the Player who has won the most games
                of that Game. You can lose the Champion Badge if another Player wins more games of the given Game.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline">What Are Achievements?</h3>
<p>
    Achievements are permanent awards that Players earn by meeting certain conditions. There can be multiple levels of Achievements
    (e.g. Bronze, Silver, Gold) that are achieved at different thresholds. Due to the intense calculations that go into some Achievements,
    there may be a delay in the time it takes for an Achievement to show up for a Player.

    For a list of all possible Achievements, <a href="@Url.Action(MVC.Achievement.Index())">check out the achievements page</a>.
